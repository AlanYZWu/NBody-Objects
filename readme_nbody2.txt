/**********************************************************************
 *  Problem A: 
 *  Compare this approach to the approach in HW2. Why is it better to 
 *  decompose a problem using objects?
 **********************************************************************/
    It's better to decompose the problem because it separates all the individual 
    blocks of code that went into the original NBody. It was much easier to read and
    debug the code this time around because it was a lot cleaner and easier to
    understand when all the code that say updated the planet's position was grouped
    together. The code from the previous NBody assignment was very difficult to read
    at the end.previous
/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.                    
 **********************************************************************/
    None in particular.

 *  Very Easy (you may add comments alongside your rating).                                   
 **********************************************************************/
    Somewhat Easy. It's not like I didn't have to try and think hard for this
    assignment, but there wasn't a point where I felt truly stumped or confused.

        Somewhat good.

    Somewhat good.





/**********************************************************************
 *  Did this assignment help you understand objects better? Helped 
 *  significantly, helped somewhat, barely helped, did not help at all.                                  
 **********************************************************************/
    Somewhere between helped somewhat and helped significantly. It defintely wasn't
    like some amazing assignment that made me perfectly understand objects, but
    saying it only helped somewhat feels too harsh. It was a good assingment.
